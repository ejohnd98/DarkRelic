magic system:

kind of like pokemon
you can only know maybe 5 or 6 spells (or that's all you can equip?)
can learn some basic spells as you level up, but also can find tomes that teach you spells as rare loot.
Plus have scrolls like in Oblivion that let you cast spells once without any magic requirements
